## Implementation Order Rationale

1. **Foundation First**: Setting up the project structure and database ensures a solid base for all subsequent development.

2. **Authentication Early**: User management and security should be implemented before any user-facing features.

3. **Data Models Core**: All functionality depends on the core data models being properly designed and implemented.

4. **Seed Data Before UI**: Having test data available makes UI development more efficient and realistic.

5. **Public Interface Priority**: The public-facing features are the primary user experience and should be perfected first.

6. **Admin Interface Last**: Administrative features are important but secondary to the core user experience.

## Development Best Practices

### Code Organization
- Use consistent file naming conventions
- Implement proper TypeScript types
- Follow React best practices
- Maintain clean component architecture

### Security Considerations
- Validate all inputs on client and server
- Use parameterized queries
- Implement proper authentication checks
- Follow OWASP security guidelines

### Performance Guidelines
- Optimize image loading and sizing
- Use proper caching strategies
- Implement lazy loading where appropriate
- Monitor and optimize database queries

### Testing Strategy
- Write tests for all critical functionality
- Test security and validation logic
- Verify responsive design across devices
- Test accessibility compliance

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Database Performance**: Implement proper indexing and query optimization
- **File Upload Security**: Validate file types and implement virus scanning
- **Authentication Vulnerabilities**: Use established libraries and security best practices

### Project Risks
- **Scope Creep**: Maintain focus on MVP features first
- **Timeline Delays**: Build in buffer time for complex features
- **Data Privacy**: Implement proper consent and privacy controls
