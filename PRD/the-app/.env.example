# Image Processing Configuration
# NOTE: Maximum upload size is 10MB (configured in next.config.ts)
# Images larger than this will be rejected with a 413 error

# For images, choose ONE sizing method:
# Option 1: Max dimension (preserves aspect ratio within a square boundary)
IMAGE_MAX_SIZE="1200"              # Image fits within 1200x1200, aspect ratio preserved

# Option 2: Fixed width (height auto-calculated from aspect ratio)
# IMAGE_WIDTH="1200"               # Width in pixels, height auto-calculated

# Option 3: Fixed height (width auto-calculated from aspect ratio)
# IMAGE_HEIGHT="1200"              # Height in pixels, width auto-calculated

# Image quality settings (JPEG compression 1-100)
# Lower values = smaller files but lower quality
# Higher values = larger files but better quality
#
# Approximate file sizes stored in database (for a typical photo):
# Quality 90-100: 300-500KB per image
# Quality 85:     200-300KB per image
# Quality 80:     150-250KB per image
# Quality 70:     100-150KB per image (default - good balance)
# Quality 60:     70-120KB per image
# Quality 50:     50-100KB per image (noticeable quality loss)
#
# Note: Actual sizes depend on image content, dimensions, and complexity
# Images with more detail/colors will be larger than simple images
