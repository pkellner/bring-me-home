# Cache Configuration
# ==================
# IMPORTANT: Cache hierarchy is: Memory -> Redis -> Database
# When data is fetched from the database, it populates BOTH memory and Redis caches (if enabled)
# When memory cache expires but Redis has data, memory cache is populated from Redis
# This provides better performance while maintaining data consistency



# Memory cache settings
CACHE_MEMORY_TTL="300"              # Time-to-live in seconds (default: 5 minutes)
CACHE_MEMORY_MAX_SIZE_MB="100"      # Maximum memory usage in MB (default: 100MB)
CACHE_MEMORY_CLEANUP_ENABLED="true" # Enable automatic cleanup of expired entries
CACHE_MEMORY_CLEANUP_INTERVAL_MS="60000" # Cleanup interval in milliseconds (default: 1 minute)

# Redis cache settings
CACHE_REDIS_TTL="3600"              # Time-to-live in seconds (default: 1 hour)
REDIS_HOST="localhost"              # Redis server host
REDIS_PORT="6379"                   # Redis server port
REDIS_FOLDER_PREFIX="bring-me-home-local" # Redis key prefix for folder organization (all keys will start with this)

# Image Processing Configuration
# NOTE: Maximum upload size is 10MB (configured in next.config.ts)
# Images larger than this will be rejected with a 413 error

# For images, choose ONE sizing method:
# Option 1: Max dimension (preserves aspect ratio within a square boundary)
IMAGE_MAX_SIZE="1200"              # Image fits within 1200x1200, aspect ratio preserved

# Option 2: Fixed width (height auto-calculated from aspect ratio)
# IMAGE_WIDTH="1200"               # Width in pixels, height auto-calculated

# Option 3: Fixed height (width auto-calculated from aspect ratio)
# IMAGE_HEIGHT="1200"              # Height in pixels, width auto-calculated

# Image quality settings (JPEG compression 1-100)
# Lower values = smaller files but lower quality
# Higher values = larger files but better quality
#
# Approximate file sizes stored in database (for a typical photo):
# Quality 90-100: 300-500KB per image
# Quality 85:     200-300KB per image
# Quality 80:     150-250KB per image
# Quality 70:     100-150KB per image (default - good balance)
# Quality 60:     70-120KB per image
# Quality 50:     50-100KB per image (noticeable quality loss)
#
# Note: Actual sizes depend on image content, dimensions, and complexity
# Images with more detail/colors will be larger than simple images
#
IMAGE_QUALITY="70"                 # JPEG quality 1-100 (default 70 for ~100KB files)
