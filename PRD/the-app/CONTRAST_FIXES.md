# Contrast and Theme Fixes Summary

## Overview
Fixed text contrast issues throughout the admin interface to improve readability and accessibility. The main issue was that input fields were using browser default colors which were too light, making text hard to read while typing.

## Changes Made

### 1. Global CSS (src/app/globals.css)
- **Text Secondary**: Changed opacity from 0.8 to 0.9
- **Text Muted**: Changed opacity from 0.6 to 0.75

### 2. RichTextEditor Component
- **HTML Source Mode**: Changed text color from `text-gray-100` to `text-white`
- **Placeholder Text**: Changed from `#9ca3af` to `#6b7280` (darker gray)

### 3. Admin Grid Components
Fixed low-contrast elements in multiple admin grids:

#### PersonsGrid.tsx
- Search input placeholder: Changed focus state from `placeholder-gray-500` to `placeholder-gray-600`
- Search icon: Changed from `text-gray-400` to `text-gray-500`
- Grid icons (Building, Photo, Chat, Users): Changed from `text-gray-400` to `text-gray-500`
- Town/state text: Changed from `text-gray-400` to `text-gray-500`

#### TownsGrid.tsx  
- Search input placeholder: Changed focus state from `placeholder-gray-500` to `placeholder-gray-600`
- Search icon: Changed from `text-gray-400` to `text-gray-500`
- Grid icons (Building, MapPin, User, Users): Changed from `text-gray-400` to `text-gray-500`

#### CommentsGrid.tsx
- Search input placeholder: Changed from `placeholder-gray-500` to `placeholder-gray-600`
- Search input focus placeholder: Changed from `placeholder-gray-400` to `placeholder-gray-600`
- Search icon: Changed from `text-gray-400` to `text-gray-500`
- Grid icons (User, DocumentText): Changed from `text-gray-400` to `text-gray-500`

## WCAG Compliance
These changes ensure better compliance with WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards:
- Normal text: Minimum contrast ratio of 4.5:1
- Large text: Minimum contrast ratio of 3:1
- UI components: Minimum contrast ratio of 3:1

### 5. Admin Input Fields (NEW)
Created admin-specific CSS file to fix input text colors:
- **Location**: `/src/app/admin/admin.css`
- **Applied to**: All input, textarea, and select elements in admin area
- **Text color**: Set to `rgb(17 24 39)` (text-gray-900) for all form inputs
- **Placeholder color**: Set to `rgb(107 114 128)` (text-gray-500)
- **Disabled state**: Properly styled with readable gray color
