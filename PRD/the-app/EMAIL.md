## Overview

The Bring Me Home application uses email for:
- Password reset functionality
- Future features: Admin notifications, user communications

The email system is designed to be flexible and supports multiple providers:
- **Console**: Logs emails to console (default for development)
- **SMTP**: Traditional email servers (Gmail, Outlook, etc.)
- **SendGrid**: Cloud-based email service
- **AWS SES**: Amazon's email service

## Supported Email Providers

### Provider Comparison

| Provider | Best For | Pricing | Setup Complexity | Deliverability |
|----------|----------|---------|------------------|----------------|
| Console | Development/Testing | Free | None | N/A |
| SMTP | Small volume, existing email | Varies | Medium | Varies |
| SendGrid | Medium-high volume | Free tier available | Easy | Excellent |
| AWS SES | High volume, AWS users | Pay per use | Medium | Excellent |

## Configuration

### Setting the Email Provider

Set the `EMAIL_PROVIDER` environment variable in your `.env` file:

```env
EMAIL_PROVIDER="console"  # Options: console, smtp, sendgrid, ses
EMAIL_PROVIDER_LOG_SMTP="false"  # Set to "true" for detailed logging
```

### Enable Detailed Logging

For debugging email issues, enable detailed SMTP logging:

```env
EMAIL_PROVIDER_LOG_SMTP="true"
```

This will log:
- Complete response details from email providers
- Full error information when sending fails
- Request/response headers and metadata
- Status codes and message IDs

Example SendGrid success log:
```
üìß SendGrid Send Response:
-------------------
Status Code: 202
Message ID: <unique-message-id@sendgrid.net>
Headers: {
  "server": "nginx",
  "x-message-id": "<unique-message-id@sendgrid.net>",
  ...
}
Body: ""
-------------------
```

Example error log:
```
‚ùå Email Send Error Details:
-------------------
Provider: sendgrid
Error Type: BadRequestError
Error Message: The from email does not contain a valid email.
Response Status: 400
Error Code: E_BAD_REQUEST
-------------------
```

### Console (Default)

The console provider logs all emails to the terminal instead of sending them. This is perfect for development and testing.

```env
EMAIL_PROVIDER="console"
```

When using the console provider, you'll see output like:
```
========================================
üìß EMAIL LOG (Provider: console)
========================================
To: user@example.com
Subject: Reset Your Bring Me Home Password
From: "Bring Me Home" <support@example.com>
========================================
Email Content Preview:
Password Reset Request You requested to reset...
========================================

üîë Password Reset URL: http://localhost:3000/auth/reset-password?token=...
```

### SMTP

SMTP works with traditional email servers and services like Gmail, Outlook, or custom email servers.

#### Gmail Configuration

1. Create an App Password (not your regular Gmail password):
   - Go to https://myaccount.google.com/security
   - Enable 2-factor authentication
   - Search for "App passwords"
   - Generate a new app password for "Mail"

2. Configure your `.env`:
```env
EMAIL_PROVIDER="smtp"
SMTP_HOST="smtp.gmail.com"
SMTP_PORT="587"
SMTP_SECURE="false"
SMTP_USER="your-email@gmail.com"
SMTP_PASS="your-16-char-app-password"  # The app password you generated
```

#### Other SMTP Providers

**Outlook/Office 365:**
```env
EMAIL_PROVIDER="smtp"
SMTP_HOST="smtp-mail.outlook.com"
SMTP_PORT="587"
SMTP_SECURE="false"
SMTP_USER="your-email@outlook.com"
SMTP_PASS="your-password"
```

**Custom SMTP Server:**
```env
EMAIL_PROVIDER="smtp"
SMTP_HOST="mail.yourdomain.com"
SMTP_PORT="465"  # or 587 for TLS
SMTP_SECURE="true"  # true for port 465, false for 587
SMTP_USER="noreply@yourdomain.com"
SMTP_PASS="your-password"
```

### SendGrid

SendGrid is a cloud-based email service that's easy to set up and offers excellent deliverability.

1. Sign up at https://sendgrid.com (free tier available)
2. Create an API key:
   - Go to Settings ‚Üí API Keys
   - Click "Create API Key"
   - Give it "Full Access" permissions
   - Copy the key (you won't see it again!)

3. Verify a sender email:
   - Go to Settings ‚Üí Sender Authentication
   - Verify a single sender email address

4. Configure your `.env`:
```env
EMAIL_PROVIDER="sendgrid"
SENDGRID_API_KEY="SG.xxxxxxxxxxxx"  # Your API key
SENDGRID_FROM_EMAIL="verified-email@yourdomain.com"  # Optional, uses ADMIN_EMAIL if not set
```

### AWS SES

Amazon Simple Email Service (SES) is cost-effective for high-volume email sending.

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: AWS SES Sandbox Mode ‚ö†Ô∏è**
By default, new AWS SES accounts are in sandbox mode with these restrictions:
- You can only send emails TO verified email addresses
- You can only send FROM verified email addresses
- Daily sending limit of 200 emails
- Maximum send rate of 1 email per second

1. Set up AWS SES:
   - Log into AWS Console
   - Go to Amazon SES
   - Verify your domain or email addresses (for sending FROM)
   - **For sandbox mode**: Also verify recipient emails (for sending TO)
   - **For production**: Request to move out of sandbox mode

2. Create IAM credentials with SES permissions:
```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "ses:SendEmail",
        "ses:SendRawEmail"
      ],
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}
```

3. Configure your `.env`:
```env
EMAIL_PROVIDER="ses"
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="AKIAXXXXXXXX"  # Can be shared with S3 config
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="xxxxxxxxxxxx"  # Can be shared with S3 config
AWS_SES_REGION="us-east-1"  # Your SES region
AWS_SES_FROM_EMAIL="noreply@yourdomain.com"  # Must be verified in SES
```

## Testing Email Functionality

### 1. Test Password Reset Flow

The easiest way to test email configuration:

1. Start the application: `npm run dev`
2. Navigate to http://localhost:3000/auth/signin
3. Click "Forgot Password?"
4. Enter an email address
5. Check your terminal (console) or email inbox

### 2. Test Script

Create a test script `test-email.ts`:

```typescript
import { sendEmail } from './src/lib/email';

async function testEmail() {
  try {
    const result = await sendEmail({
      to: 'test@example.com',
      subject: 'Test Email',
      html: '<h1>Test Email</h1><p>This is a test email from Bring Me Home.</p>',
    });
    console.log('Email sent successfully:', result);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Email failed:', error);
  }
}

testEmail();
```

Run with: `npx tsx test-email.ts`

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Console Provider Not Showing Logs
- Make sure `EMAIL_PROVIDER` is not set or set to "console"
- Check the terminal where `npm run dev` is running (not browser console)
- Logs appear in the server-side terminal

#### SMTP Connection Failed
- Check firewall settings (ports 587, 465)
- Verify credentials are correct
- For Gmail, ensure you're using an App Password
- Try toggling `SMTP_SECURE` based on your port

#### SendGrid Not Sending
- Verify API key has full access permissions
- Check sender email is verified in SendGrid (Settings ‚Üí Sender Authentication)
- API key should start with "SG." followed by the key
- Look for errors in SendGrid dashboard
- Ensure you're not in sandbox mode
- Common 401 errors:
  - Invalid API key
  - API key doesn't have permission for sending
  - From email not verified in SendGrid

#### AWS SES Not Sending
- Verify you're out of sandbox mode (for production)
- Check IAM permissions include ses:SendEmail
- Verify sender email/domain in SES console
- Check the correct region is configured
- **"Email address is not verified" error**: This error can mean:
  - In sandbox mode: BOTH sender AND recipient emails must be verified
  - The error message shows which email is not verified (often the recipient)
  - Example: "Email address is not verified... peter@peterkellner.net" means the recipient is not verified
  - Solution: Either verify the recipient email in SES or move out of sandbox mode

### Debug Mode

To see more detailed error messages, the email service will:
1. Log errors to console
2. Fall back to console provider if another provider fails
3. Show the full error stack trace

## Best Practices

### 1. Development vs Production

**Development:**
```env
EMAIL_PROVIDER="console"  # See emails in terminal
```

**Production:**
```env
EMAIL_PROVIDER="sendgrid"  # or "ses" for scale
SENDGRID_API_KEY="your-production-key"
```

### 2. Email Templates

Keep email templates consistent:
- Use the existing password reset template as a reference
- Include both HTML and text versions
- Test rendering in multiple email clients

### 3. Rate Limiting

The application includes built-in rate limiting:
- Password reset: 5-minute cooldown between requests
- Consider adding additional rate limiting for production

### 4. Security

- Never commit API keys or passwords to git
- Use environment variables for all credentials
- Rotate API keys regularly
- Monitor for unusual sending patterns

### 5. Sender Reputation

- Use a consistent "from" address
- Set up SPF, DKIM, and DMARC records
- Monitor bounce rates and complaints
- Warm up new sending domains gradually

## Email Provider Migration

To switch providers:

1. Update `EMAIL_PROVIDER` in `.env`
2. Add required configuration for new provider
3. Test with password reset flow
4. Deploy with new configuration

The application will automatically use the new provider without code changes.

## Future Enhancements

Planned email features:
- Email templates with handlebars
- Email queue with retry logic
- Bounce handling
- Email analytics integration
- Multi-language email support

## Support

1. Check this documentation
2. Review error logs in terminal
3. Test with console provider first
4. Verify credentials and permissions
5. Check provider-specific dashboards for errors
